                    <p class="card-text">The World around us is constantly changing. We are faced with many
                        environmental issues such as climate change. We
                        believe that it is our duty to help the environment; what better way to do that than by planting
                        trees? Mangrove trees
                        grow on the coast of Thailand which means that they are less likely to be cut down. If we're
                        making a difference we want
                        it to matter, to be long term. So help us make the world a better place.</p>

                        collective individuals
                        internationally to stop oil and gas development and move to 100 percent renewable energy.</p>
